//Node is basically the Google JS engine but without browser functionality and specifically made for backend development
//We can use the REPL (terminal environment) to play around with Node code
//We usually use CLI executables (like this one) in order to make serious applications
//
// COMMANDS
// Node          - Runs terminal environment
// Node app.js   - Runs a file within the node environment
